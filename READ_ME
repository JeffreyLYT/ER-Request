** DESCRIPTION ***

This is a simple web app using Google Places API, IP Location API (could easily be extended to GPS tracking 
for Android and iOS devices), and FitBit API that lets users send (stores the info in a DB for now) Emergency 
Room (ER) processing requests to the nearest hospital in cases of various injuries. The idea is that the patients 
will help alleviate wait times in hospitals by providing information enabling doctors and nurses to being the 
triage process in advance, before the patients arrive to their closest hospital effectively. The use of the 
FitBit API allows the collection and dispatch of real-time heart rate information onm patients for a more accurate 
diagnosis. Additionally, patients will provide a short description of their injuries in order to complete a 
preliminary triage phase before even showing up to a hospital. Ideally, the app, once hosted, would allow anyone, 
not simply registered patients, to make requests for persons that aren't necessarily themselves. The finalized project
would also allow for a time estimation as well as displaying the waitlist position in which the patient is placed
after sending a request. This would also require spam filtering and/or background checking the users of the web app.

*** PREREQUISITES ***

-NodeJS installed on the host machine. 
-A working MongoDB locally hosted server (on the web app's domain) on the default port (27017).
-Replace all URLs starting with '10.202' to the domain your server is hosted on (use localhost if you don't have a domain).
-A working FitBit connected to their official website and linked with your account (not necessary, but recommended).
-A valid SSL certificate (the one provided is self-signed).

*** USAGE ***

-Open a command-line interpreter and execute NodeJS with the 'app.js' script included in the root project folder.
-Open any browser and access the app's domain on port 3000 for HTTP and port 3001 for HTTPS.
-Register and login through the provided interface.
-Send and view requests you've sent through the provided links.
-Additionally, admin users have access to the user database.

*** TODO ***

-Actually send the information to hospitals.
-Use GPS location for mobile devices.
-Beautify the interface with JS client-side animations.
